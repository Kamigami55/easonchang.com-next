## Introduction

**"SigmaGO Smart Guide Dog"** is a software-hardware integrated project we developed during the **[2017 National Taiwan University Hackathon HackNTU](https://hackntu.tumblr.com/tagged/intro)** in July 2017.

The project's aim is to develop a low-cost smart guide dog to replace traditional guide dogs that require significant training costs, benefiting the lives of the visually impaired.

Technologically, it uses a **Raspberry Pi 3** for processing, connected to the **[Olami Chinese Language Semantic Recognition Platform](https://tw.olami.ai/open/website/home/home_show)** provided by Via Technologies, to instantly recognize user's voice commands. The **Arduino** car (prototype of the mechanical guide dog) will then lead the user to their destination.

This project won the **Via Technologies Super Hacker Award** and the **Technical Popularity Award** at the event.

## Detailed Introduction

### Origin: Why the World Needs SigmaGO

From selection, training to matching and service, guide dogs dedicate their lives to humanity, but it doesn't have to be this hard.
We utilize smart technology to not only give the visually impaired an extra pair of eyes but also allow dogs to live more freely.

> SigmaGO, Go For It!

### How to Use SigmaGO

1. Turn on the power switch!
2. Give commands to SigmaGo!
3. It will take you where you want to go
4. It's that simple!

### System Architecture

Using the [OLAMI Chinese Semantic Analysis Platform](https://tw.olami.ai/open/website/home/home_show) provided by Via Technologies and the Raspberry Pi 3 hardware development kit provided on-site, connected to our custom Arduino mechanical dog, allowing visually impaired individuals to naturally command the mechanical dog in Chinese. The mechanical dog will then guide them to their desired location, improving the lives of the visually impaired!
