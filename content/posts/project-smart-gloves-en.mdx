## Introduction

**"Smart Gloves"** was our project for the **[NTU Electrical Engineering Makerthon MakeNTU 2018](https://make.ntuee.org/)** at the end of March 2018.

Smart Gloves are designed to replace keyboards and mice, becoming the next generation of human-computer interface devices. They allow users to control all aspects of life, such as smart home appliances, as game controllers, playing virtual instruments, etc.

Technically, the gloves are equipped with 2 **MPU6050 6-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes** to measure hand posture, and 4 **capacitive touch switches** for customized input. They use **Linkit7697** to collect sensor data and send it back to the cloud. On the **Microsoft Azure cloud**, gesture commands are computed (currently using Python to run the **SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm** to match the current gesture commands with training data), then sent back to the controlled device (like a smart bulb).

This project was a finalist for the **Best Tech Award at NTU Electrical Engineering Makerthon**.
