In the previous article, we enabled Syntax Highlighting for code blocks. In this article, we'll add titles to them!

## Using rehype-code-titles to Add Titles to Each Code Block

Install [rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles):

```shell
pnpm add rehype-code-titles
```

Activate it by modifying `/contentlayer.config.ts`, adding rehype-code-titles to the `rehypePlugins` list:

```ts
import rehypeCodeTitles from "rehype-code-titles"; // Add this line
import rehypePrism from "rehype-prism-plus";

import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from "./src/lib/contentLayerAdapter";

// ...

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: "content",
  documentTypes: [Post],
  mdx: {
    // Add to the rehypePlugins list
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeCodeTitles, [rehypePrism, { ignoreMissing: true }]],
  },
});
```

By now, rehype-code-titles installation is complete, but it won't have any style by default. We need to specify it ourselves.

Modify `/src/components/PostBody/PostBody.module.scss`:

```scss
.postBody {
  // Add the following two sections
  :global(.rehype-code-title) {
    @apply -mb-3 rounded-tl rounded-tr bg-slate-600 px-4 pt-1 pb-2 font-mono text-sm text-gray-200;
  }

  div:global(.rehype-code-title) + pre {
    @apply rounded-tl-none rounded-tr-none;
  }

  # ...
}
```

This completes all settings!

## Modify the Article to Add Titles to Code Blocks

After the programming language marker in the code block Markdown, add a `:` colon and enter any text. This text will be considered as a title by rehype-code-title.

For example, modify `/content/posts/20220901-post-with-code.mdx`:

https://github.com/Kamigami55/nextjs-tailwind-contentlayer-blog-starter/commit/4f042ea8861adaa2d53fd7fc1a461459862719de

## Results

Done! By running `pnpm dev` and entering the recently modified article, you'll see the code blocks now have their own titles!
