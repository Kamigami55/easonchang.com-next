## TL;DR

This is the eleventh article in the "Modern Blog 30 Days" series. In the previous article, we integrated "Dark Mode" with Tailwind CSS into our Next.js blog. This article will begin styling the entire site using Tailwind CSS, beautifying elements including the Header and Footer!

Screenshot results are as follows:

## Install clsx for Conveniently Combining className Based on Conditions

We primarily use various ready-made Tailwind CSS classNames for styling. In many components, we need to provide different classNames combinations based on different conditions (props or state, etc.). Here, we use the [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) package to help us write simple, readable, and powerful className combination logic.

Use pnpm to install it:

```shell
pnpm add clsx
```

## @tailwindcss/typography for Out-of-the-box Text Styles

One advantage of Tailwind CSS is its ease of customization and quick modification. However, when initially setting up good-looking styles for basic titles, text, lists, etc., you need to add a large number of classNames, explicitly specifying font-size, font-weight, letter-spacing, etc., which can be very labor-intensive.

Fortunately, Tailwind CSS officially offers several [Plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins), including [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin). After installation, it provides `prose` series of classNames, allowing a single className to specify a series of good-looking text styles.

### Install @tailwindcss/typography

Use the following command to install the package:

```shell
pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

And modify `/tailwind.config.js` to add it to the `plugins` array:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  darkMode: "class",
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  // Modify the following line
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};
```

This completes the installation. We will actually use it later in the article.

## @svgr/webpack to Support SVG Import in Next.js

We will use SVG files in the styling process, but to directly import SVG files in Next.js's JSX/TSX for customization, some settings are needed.

We will follow this article to implement it:
[Importing SVGs to Next.js - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dolearning/importing-svgs-to-next-js-nna)

### Install @svgr/webpack

Use the command to install [@svgr/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack):

```shell
pnpm add -D @svgr/webpack
```

### Modify `/next.config.mjs`

Modify `/next.config.mjs` by adding custom webpack settings, using @svgr/webpack to support importing SVG files in JS:

```js
import { withContentlayer } from "next-contentlayer";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = withContentlayer({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  // Add the following custom webpack settings
  // Support svg import
  // ref: https://dev.to/dolearning/importing-svgs-to-next-js-nna
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.svg$/,
      use: ["@svgr/webpack"],
    });
    return config;
  },
  // Add the above custom webpack settings
  eslint: {
    // Warning: This allows production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has ESLint errors.
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has type errors.
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
});

export default nextConfig;
```

## Site-wide Style

Here we will add many components and make numerous changes. Due to space constraints, they are not all listed here. You can see these changes more clearly from this git commit:

https://github.com/Kamigami55/nextjs-tailwind-contentlayer-blog-starter/commit/61d2999b326d1dcefcc3ec

b64108946ca78062b5

Our blog's style mainly modifies the [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project, adjusting colors, component structure, and supporting TypeScript beyond the original project.

## Results

Done! Use `pnpm dev` and visit the homepage and article pages to see the beautified site-wide style! Added navbar and footer, the layout has also been beautified, and it supports mobile RWD and dark mode.
