## Introduction

The project is a timezone converter web app that allows users to convert time between different timezones and compare overlapping time periods.

I created this project with [Carol Hsiao](https://carolhsiao.webflow.io/). She designed the whole UI and I implemented the functionality.

## Demo & Source Code

It's a open-source project, you can check the demo and source code here:

- **Demo:** [timezone.eason.ch](https://timezone.eason.ch)
- **Source Code:** [github.com/Kamigami55/timezone-converter](https://github.com/Kamigami55/timezone-converter)

## Why we created this project

We created this project because we just moved from Taiwan to Canada. The timezone offset between Taiwan (UTC+8) and Canada(UTC-7) is 15 hours.

We found it difficult for our parents and friends in Taiwan to find a good time to call us.

So we wanted to create a tool that makes it easy to convert time between different timezones and compare overlapping time periods.

That's why We created the Time Zone Converter.

## Key Features

- **Time Zone Conversion:** Convert time between any two time zones effortlessly.
- **Overlap Comparison:** Compare overlapping time periods to find the best meeting times.
- **Dark Mode Support:** A user-friendly interface that supports dark mode, making it easy on the eyes during late-night planning sessions.
