This is the 23rd article in the "Modern Blog 30 Days" series.

After optimizing image performance in the previous article, we continue to improve perceived performance for readers by adding a page transition progress bar using [nprogress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress)!

The final effect is as follows:

## Adding a Page Progress Bar with nprogress

### Installing nprogress in Next.js

```shell
pnpm add nprogress
pnpm add -D @types/nprogress
```

Modify `src/pages/_app.tsx`:

```tsx
// ...
// Import nprogress/nprogress.css
import "nprogress/nprogress.css";

// ...
// Import NProgress, useRouter, useEffect
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import NProgress from "nprogress";
import { useEffect } from "react";

// Call NProgress.configure to initialize
NProgress.configure({ showSpinner: false });

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  // Add the following useEffect block to start NProgress during Next.js page transitions and stop it when the transition is complete
  const router = useRouter();

  // Integrate nprogress
  useEffect(() => {
    router.events.on("routeChangeStart", () => NProgress.start());
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", () => NProgress.done());
    router.events.on("routeChangeError", () => NProgress.done());
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  // ...
}
```

### Adjusting the Progress Bar Color

The progress bar is blue by default. To change it, you can write CSS to change the color.

Add `src/styles/nprogress-custom.scss`:

```scss
#nprogress {
  .bar {
    @apply h-1 bg-primary-500;
  }

  .peg {
    @apply shadow-[0_0_10px] shadow-primary-500;
  }
}
```

Modify `src/pages/_app.tsx` to globally import the new scss file:

```tsx
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import "@/styles/prism-dracula.css";
import "@/styles/prism-plus.css";
import "nprogress/nprogress.css";
// Add the following line to import nprogress-custom.scss
import "@/styles/nprogress-custom.scss";

// ...
```

## Results

Done! Use `pnpm dev`, and after entering the website and clicking links to switch pages, you will see a progress bar at the top during page transitions! It makes visitors more willing to wait for the page to load.

The final effect is as follows:
