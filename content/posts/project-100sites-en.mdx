# 【100sites #000】My Journey to Becoming a Full Stack Developer

To become a full stack developer, I've decided to start a large number of side-projects to learn by doing and efficiently improve the skills I need.

This is 100sites. Starting now, I will create and upload 100 web pages, explaining as much as possible about the technologies and tools I used.
