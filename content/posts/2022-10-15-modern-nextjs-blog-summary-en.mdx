This is the 30th article in the series "**Building a Dazzling Personal Blog from Scratch Using Modern Technologies like Next.js, ContentLayer, i18next, and More**".

Over these 30 days, we have gone from nothing to creating a dazzling tech blog together using modern technology.

I've open-sourced the outcome of these 30 days into the "[Next.js Tailwind Contentlayer Blog Starter](https://github.com/Kamigami55/nextjs-tailwind-contentlayer-blog-starter)" template project on GitHub.

## Looking back at these 30 days, what have we achieved

Together, we started from scratch and used the most modern front-end technologies to build a dazzling personal blog from the ground up, covering everything from basic environment setup to final website deployment and maintenance.

### Review of the Series

This 30-day journey was divided into three phases:

During days 1 to 13, we created a blog with basic functionality that looked good.

From day 14 to 19, after completing code blocks, SEO handling, sitemap, and RSS, we met all the conditions for a tech blog.

And finally, from day 20 to 30, we continued to add more dazzling and practical features to make our blog stand out!

The 30-day itinerary is as follows:
