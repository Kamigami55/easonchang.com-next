The soul of a tech blog lies in the code within its articles. Code blocks need to be readable for readers to want to continue reading.

At a minimum, code blocks should support "**Syntax Highlighting**," displaying different keywords in different colors.

In this article, we'll use [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus) to add Syntax Highlighting effects to code blocks!

## Syntax Highlighting

To add Syntax Highlighting to web code blocks, there are several packages available, including popular ones like [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

Here, we'll use PrismJS.

## Adding Syntax Highlighting with rehype-prism-plus

Our blog uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), which processes Markdown and MDX files using [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler).

mdx-bundler, in turn, uses [mdx-js](https://mdxjs.com/).

To customize how mdx-js processes Markdown or MDX, you can install [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) or [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugins. They are responsible for converting Markdown and MDX to HTML, and installing plugins allows us to modify the HTML as desired.

We can use the [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus) rehype plugin to implement PrismJS's Syntax Highlighting.

It supports a vast array of programming languages (see [PrismJS language list](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages)) and dozens of themes (see [PrismJS theme list](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)), as well as highlighting specific lines, and showing red and green diff files.

## Installing rehype-prism-plus

Run the following command to install:

```shell
pnpm add rehype-prism-plus
```

Modify `contentlayer.config.ts`, adding rehypePrism to the rehypePlugins for mdx:

```ts
// Add the following line
import rehypePrism from "rehype-prism-plus";

// ...

export default makeSource({
  // ...
  // Add the following line
  mdx: { rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrism, { ignoreMissing: true }]] },
});
```

Add `src/styles/prism-plus.css`, styles for line numbers highlighting by rehype-prism-plus:

```css
/* https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus#styling */

pre {
  overflow-x: auto;
}

/**
 * Inspired by gatsby remark prism - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-prismjs/
 * 1. Make the element just wide enough to fit its content.
 * 2. Always fill the visible space in .code-highlight.
 */
.code-highlight {
  float: left; /* 1 */
  min-width: 100%; /* 2 */
}

.code-line {
  display: block;
  padding-left: 16px;
  padding-right: 16px;
  margin-left: -16px;
  margin-right: -16px;
  border-left-width: 4px;
  border-left-color: rgba(31, 41, 55, 0); /* Set code block color */
}

.code-line.inserted {
  background-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.2); /* Set inserted line (+) color */
}

.code-line.deleted {
  background-color: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2); /* Set deleted line

 (-) color */
}

.highlight-line {
  margin-left: -16px;
  margin-right: -16px;
  background-color: rgba(55, 65, 81, 0.5); /* Set highlight bg color */
  border-left-width: 4px;
  border-left-color: rgb(59, 130, 246); /* Set highlight accent border color */
}

.line-number::before {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 1rem;
  text-align: right;
  margin-right: 16px;
  margin-left: -8px;
  color: rgb(156, 163, 175); /* Line number color */
  content: attr(line);
}
```

Next, you'll also need to add a basic theme for PrismJS.

> You can find your preferred theme here:
> https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes
>
> I personally use this Dracula theme:
> https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-darcula.css

Add `src/styles/prism-dracula.css`, a chosen theme style for PrismJS:

```css
/**
 * Dracula Theme originally by Zeno Rocha [@zenorocha]
 * https://draculatheme.com/
 *
 * Ported for PrismJS by Albert Vallverdu [@byverdu]
 */
/* Style content omitted for brevity */
```

Modify `src/pages/_app.tsx` to include the new CSS files:

```tsx
import "@/styles/prism-dracula.css";
import "@/styles/prism-plus.css";

// ...
```

This completes all settings!

## Adding an Article Containing Code

Add `/content/posts/20220901-post-with-code.mdx`:

> Due to contest article restrictions, code blocks within code blocks are indented. Remember to remove the indentation when pasting into your own blog.
>
> Or view the original `20220901-post-with-code.mdx` content here:
>
> https://github.com/Kamigami55/nextjs-tailwind-contentlayer-blog-starter/blob/0f72528c220430e21bee232dd9f81b6e175086d2/content/posts/20220901-post-with-code.mdx?plain=1

## Results

Done! By running `pnpm dev` and entering the newly added article, you'll see the code styling looks much better!
