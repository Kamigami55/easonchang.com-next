## Who's Eason Chang

Hey! I am **Eason Chang (Yin-Hsiang Chang)** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Fullstack Developer / Maker**. I love to build interesting [cool stuff](/projects)! My goal is to make humanity better with my inventions.

I also love writing [posts](/posts), covering software engineering, web dev, maker, and productivity.

I'm a Taiwanese ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼, big fan of bubble tea ðŸ§‹! I'm currently living in Calgary, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, actively seeking a job!

## Hire me

I am actively seeking any opportunities in Canada. I am open to **full-time, part-time, contract, or internship positions**. I am also open **on-site** or **remote** work, and willing to **relocate** to a different city if needed.

I am a **software engineer** with **5 years of experience**, specializing in web **frontend** development using modern technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also have experience in **backend** development using Node.js, Python, Golang, and **cloud platforms** like AWS.

I used to work in both fast-paced startup environment at [GDP Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gdp-world/) (a FinTech startup), and in big corporate environments at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/) (a leading cybersecurity company).
